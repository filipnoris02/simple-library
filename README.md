"# simple-library" 
this is my first attempt at making a library app with register/login feature and admin login with admin capabilities like adding books to the database (notepad) 
the users dont have any restriction on how many books they can take right now and all of the users share the same books (there is no different inventory for each user, they all use same notepad file)
the books also dont have quantity theyre just unlimited.
